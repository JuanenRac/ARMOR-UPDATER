### Detects, installs and updates every A.R.M.O.R. repository on the machine it runs on (a Python program with no required dependencies, built for a private ecosystem from the start)

**Honesty check - what runs today:** **Maturity: scaffolding.** The manifest discovery, version comparison, atomic-by-verification install/update and evidence log are tested (109 tests) against A.R.M.O.R.'s own manifest shape; it has never installed or updated a real A.R.M.O.R. repository end to end, because every one of them is private and that needs a real GITHUB_TOKEN this program has not yet been given.

---

## 🎯 Overview

* **Discovery, no fixed list:** a local folder joins the moment it carries a valid `armor.project.json` declaring `ecosystem: "A.R.M.O.R."`; remotely, every repository a `GITHUB_TOKEN` can see on GitHub is checked the same way - every A.R.M.O.R. repository is private, so that token is required throughout, with no 60-requests-an-hour fallback a public ecosystem could fall back to.
* **Install and update, never in place:** an update is built and verified in an independent staging clone first, and only promoted - two directory renames, the previous install kept as a backup - once that build actually succeeds; a genuinely uncommitted local edit is refused outright, never silently discarded.
* **Evidence:** every attempt, successful or not, appends one line to a local log with the project, the version and commit before and after, and the reason for a failure.
* **A CLI and an optional desktop shell:** `armor-updater status`/`install`/`update`, and a Qt Quick interface (`pip install ".[gui]"`) in the ecosystem's seven languages.

## 🛠️ Development Environment

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"                                # or ".[dev,gui]" for the optional Qt Quick desktop shell
python -m pytest tests -q                              # 109 tests
armor-updater status                                    # local + GitHub state of every repository (needs GITHUB_TOKEN)
armor-updater install ARMOR-NETWORK                     # clone and build one repository that is not installed yet
armor-updater update ARMOR-NETWORK                      # atomic-by-verification update
```
